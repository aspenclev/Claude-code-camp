2026-02-24 10:45:16 From David Berkal to Everyone:
	Replying to "oakland_ascii_art.txt":
	I had this issue. The fix was downloading GIT and doing the following: 
	Find your Git installation path (usually C:\Program Files\Git\bin\git.exe)
	Set the environment variable:
	• Press Windows + R, type sysdm.cpl
	• Click "Environment Variables"
	• Under "System Variables," click "New"
	• Variable name: CLAUDE_CODE_GIT_BASH_PATH
	• Variable value: Your Git executable path
	Restart Claude Code completely

2026-02-24 11:28:01 From meganbuerger to Everyone:

	My personal experience: Wispr flow/Monologue do a better job of understanding my speech, and they're a little smarter. You can say something like "make a list" and start listing stuff, it'll format the last, not just transcribe your exact words. Monologue also lets you add prompts to format or modify the output of your convo

	Step 2: Download the data (3 dots in upper righthand corner)

	I found this very helpful but can see the added value of using Claude code on desktop rather than sharing the csv to Claude or Gemini and asking for the same thing. Plus this takes considerable longer. 
	
	Or is it that with the same framework you will be able to do more complex things than in the browser are not possible?

	I worked in regular Chat to build this, not even Cowork or Claude Code. I think this aspect is very interesting, as I’m increasingly not understanding the reason Claude Code is valuable compared to chat and code for things like this.
	
2026-02-24 12:09:00 From Sulaiman Rahman to Everyone:
	Replying to "Made an interactive version that updates voice of ...":
	This was the prompt, nothing too ground breaking. I have a habit of asking a question instead of just telling it what I want.

2026-02-24 12:09:29 From Dan Sleeman to Everyone:

	Click the sidebar icon on top left, and then “New Session”

	You can use the same folder
	
2026-02-24 12:12:44 From Mateo García to Everyone:
